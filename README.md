# Introduction
introduction to my gitHub

Hello people,
My name is André and I'm 23 years old now (2021). 
I am undergraduating in Mechanical engineering at the end of this year.
I'm trying to learn more about computer programming in order to use it in my future projects.
I hope to learn a lot in GitHub community and also contribute to all you with what I know!

Let's keep focus on our objectives,
André
